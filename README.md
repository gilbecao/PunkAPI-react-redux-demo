# Punk API Demo

This project retrieves data from [PunkAPI](https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers).

## You can find in the app:
* BEM
* Semantic HTML
* Unit and component testing
* SASS
* Redux to handle local state
* Mobile first, full responsive styles
* Bootstrap (just a little bit to make it look good :D)
* Environment variables
* HOC
* SOLID
* DRY
* ESLint
* SonarQube

## and with more time:
* I would like to add [react query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) which is an excellent option to handle server state.
* Also would be recommended to add snapshot testing for every component that is considered DONE.
* And finally, using Sagas instead of Thunk to handle async actions.
